My name is Ray Mannion and I am a 3rd student at the 
Galway/Mayo Institute of Technology studying 
Software Development

In this repository you will find a project I was asked to complete  
during second year.

The project was to create a basic text editor that could parse in a tect file or ur.
The progam could  then count, search, add and delete words in 
the text file of url. 

In the folder there is another readMe file showing you how to run the program and also a small user manaual.
